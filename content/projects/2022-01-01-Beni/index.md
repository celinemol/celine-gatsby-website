description: "The easiest way to shop secondhand. Beni finds the best resale alternatives from across the internet in the click of a button.

The browser extension aggregates secondhand alternatives while you shop and then shows you all the best options in one place.  Itâ€™s like Honey meets Expedia for re-commerce.  A shopper can browse familiar retail websites (Madewell, Patagonia, Reformation, etc.), click on the Beni browser extension and instantly see a curated list of secondhand alternatives from over a dozen re-commerce platforms (TheRealReal, eBay, Rent the Runway, Vestiaire Collective, etc.).  With Beni, shoppers are empowered to make the right choice for their closet and their wallet."
