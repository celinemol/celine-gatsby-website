description: "This group is about the Python programming language and its applications. At events we will provide time and space for people in the community to connect. We will have talks on web development frameworks like Django, Flask, and FastAPI. We will also have speakers share their experience using libraries for data science (Pandas, NumPy) and machine learning (Keras, PyTorch).

Everyone from absolute beginners to experts are welcome to join!
