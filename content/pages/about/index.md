Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Celine. 

I believe that circular business models are critical to achieving the necessary fashion emission reduction targets for a healthy planet, and waste is a design flaw. With my technical mind and innovative spirit, I'm committed to making resale the new norm. Thatâ€™s why I co-founded Beni, a tool to make secondhand shopping online easier than ever. 

Prior to founding Beni, I leveraged my background in environmental science (UCSB MESM, Bren School â€˜17-â€™19) and data science (UCSB B.S. Statistical Sciences â€˜14-â€™17) to pursue these passions at Apeel Sciences, a UCSB-grown biotech startup focused on fighting food waste. During my 3 years there as a software engineer, in addition to building great relationships with my fellow engineers, I built a globally-used data collection platform from the ground up to gain insights on fruit behavior. 

When I'm is not working on Beni, you can catch me playing outside or eating soup (yes, even on a hot day).
