description: "When you think about NFTs, you might imagine Silicon Valley finance bros trading digital images like theyâ€™re baseball cards (perhaps because sometimes NFTs actually are used to purchase baseball cards.) But the history and implications of NFTs are much more complex than that, and to understand their true value in modern commerce we must first navigate the intersection of tech, art history, law, and even feminism."
