description: "There's no denying that buying pre-loved or secondhand can be better for the environment. Though, if you're a selective shopper, often it can be hard to know where to begin. While we all appreciate the thrill of trawling through endless racks at a charity shop and finding that special needle-in-a-haystack, if you're looking for a specific item, often vintage shopping can be a frustrating endeavour. And that's exactly where Beni comes in."
