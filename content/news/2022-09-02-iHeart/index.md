description: "The Resale Edit: WeeklyEdition #3-This past week we saw the launch of three new brand resale platforms: Michael Kors, Marimekko, and PrettyLittleThing (PLT). Dicks Sporting Good expanded a local trade-in program, Amazon invested in Cashify, an Indian electronics trade-in marketplace, Trove reached 700 U.S. stores with trade-in technology and The Cut gave us a not-so-nice peak inside The Real Real."
